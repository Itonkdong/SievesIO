# SievesIO

## Project Overview
**SievesIO** is a parallelized implementation of prime number sieving algorithms, focusing on optimizing the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** and **Sieve of Euler**. The project explores the impact of **parallel computing** on prime generation efficiency, balancing the trade-off between **parallel overhead** and **speedup**.

## Features
- ✅ Parallelized versions of the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** and **Sieve of Euler**
- ✅ Uses **Java’s ExecutorService** for multi-threading
- ✅ Performance analysis on different thread counts
- ✅ Investigates the **optimal number of threads** for best efficiency
- ✅ Potential applications in **cryptography** and **number theory**
